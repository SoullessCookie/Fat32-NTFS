# Fat32-NTFS
Simple batch file that converts a drive from Fat32 to NTFS without destruction of data

You need to download the Fat32-NTFS.bat file
To run, double click the file on your desktop or file explorer
When prompted, enter the drive letter that you would like to convert
Boom... You're done

If that didn't work, you may need to run the file as Administrator (Windows works funny)
For the dumb people, this is for WINDOWS ONLYYY

WARNING: Don't reformat your main drive if it is using FAT32, that is a bad idea unless you know what you're doing

If you want to edit the file for yourself, right click the file in your file explorer, choose edit. Just make sure to save after you're done.
